## April 2025, Los Coyotes, New Mexico

The New Mexico sun beat down on the dusty crossroad near Los Coyotes Reservoir. April in the hills was deceptive – warm enough to be pleasant, but with a bite in the wind that hinted at the mountains looming above. Two cyclists paused, their bikes leaning against a weathered fence post. One, a younger man, was taking a long swig from his water bottle, his gaze fixed on the relentlessly upward slope of the road that disappeared into the hills. The other, an older gentleman, watched him with a knowing smile.

The younger man, mid-fifties, wiped his brow with the back of his hand. His bike, a sturdy but clearly budget-conscious model from Walmart, sported a rusty metal cargo basket bolted to the handlebars. He wore faded basketball shorts, a Golden State Warriors t-shirt, and well-worn sneakers. He looked like he’s seen a few miles, but not the kind that involved conquering mountains.

The older man, in stark contrast, was a picture of athletic grace. He was eighty-one, yet his posture was impeccable, his movements fluid. His carbon fiber road bike gleamed in the sunlight, a testament to both his passion and his means. He wore a neat, high-performance cycling kit, and his face, though lined with age, held a vitality that belied his years.

"Tough climb ahead," the older man observed, his voice surprisingly strong.

The younger man grunted in agreement. "Thinking about skipping it. Looks brutal."

"It is," the older man chuckled. "Mt. Hulk. Not for the faint of heart." He paused, considering. "What do you do?"

The younger man shrugged. "Odd jobs. Mostly carpentry. Keeps me busy."

The older man smiled. "And what about you? What do *you* do?"

The man hesitated, a flicker of amusement in his eyes. "I'm an Organic Plumber."

The younger man raised an eyebrow, clearly intrigued. "Organic? What does that even mean?"

The older man laughed, a warm, genuine sound. "It's a bit of a joke, really. A way of saying I fix things. People. Not pipes, exactly." He let the words hang in the air, a subtle hint at a deeper meaning.

He thought back, a cascade of memories flooding his mind. *Fifty years ago…* He’s a young resident, fresh out of medical school, starting his journey at the hospital just outside of Los Coyotes. The weight of responsibility, the thrill of discovery, the long, grueling hours. He remembered the exhaustion, the triumphs, the quiet satisfaction of easing someone's suffering.

*1985…* The year he and his wife bought their house, the one they still lived in, overlooking the valley. A modest place, filled with love and laughter, a sanctuary from the demands of his profession. He remembered the excitement of planting their first garden, the joy of creating a home.

He’s ridden countless challenging roads. The French Alps, a dizzying ascent through snow-capped peaks. Italy, a tapestry of rolling hills and ancient villages. Germany, a relentless grind through dense forests. Switzerland, a breathtaking panorama of glaciers and turquoise lakes. But Mt. Hulk… Mt. Hulk was different. It was a beast. A test of endurance. He’s yet to ride it again this year.

He thought of his wife, Eleanor. He remembered their first meeting in 1965, a chance encounter at a local bookstore. Her smile, her intelligence, her unwavering support. He remembered the day their first son, David, was born in 1976, a moment of pure, unadulterated joy. He still read the news every morning, meticulously following developments in politics, science, and sports. He believed in staying informed, in understanding the world around him.

The younger man, still curious, prompted, "So, what exactly *did* you do?"

The older man smiled, a hint of melancholy in his eyes. "I was a heart surgeon. That’s where the ‘Organic Plumber’ comes in. I repaired the most vital organ, the very essence of life. You could say I fixed people, inside and out."

He looked at the younger man, a silent understanding passing between them. The younger man’s gaze softened, a newfound respect evident in his eyes.

As they neared the junction where they would part ways, a sense of quiet contentment settled over the scene. The sun seemed to shine a little brighter, the air a little sweeter. It was one of those moments, fleeting and precious, that would linger in memory long after the encounter was over. A great story, a great old man, a simple conversation on a dusty crossroad.

The older man extended his hand. "Enjoy the ride," he said, his voice filled with genuine warmth.

The younger man shook his hand firmly. "You too," he replied, a smile playing on his lips.

And as the older man turned his bike and began the ascent of Mt. Hulk, the younger man watched him go, a profound sense of admiration filling his heart. The day was setting down, promising a memory that would be cherished for years to come.

# **Title: *The Last High***

## **January 6, 2025**

The *Hop & Hearth Brewery* was as it always was-dimly lit, the air thick with the scent of hops and the faint tang of spilled beer. The usual crowd of regulars had gathered around the long wooden tables, their voices a low hum of camaraderie. Tonight, though, something was different. The air felt heavier, charged with an unspoken tension that none of them could quite name.

At the center of it all was **Derek**, the self-proclaimed "master of the universe," a man whose opinions were as voluminous as his belly and his stories as legendary as they were exaggerated. He was midway through his third pint, his fingers tracing the condensation on the glass as he leaned in to deliver his latest revelation.

*"So, I'm telling you, folks, this isn't just a crisis-it's a *revelation*. A cosmic wink from the universe itself!"* He slurred slightly, his eyes gleaming with the kind of manic energy that suggested he'd already consumed more than his fair share of both beer and his own ego. *"All those years of chasing the dragon, the green, the white powder-gone. Just like that. And let me tell you, I've been *thinking* about it. This isn't an accident. This is a *message*."*

Beside him, **Marlon**, the brewery's owner and the only one who could actually keep up with Derek's rambling, sighed and wiped down a glass with a rag. *"Derek, you're not making any sense. You're saying the universe *wanted* us to stop getting high?"*

*"No, no, no-*better*. The universe is *cleansing* us. Like a bad hangover after a decade of debauchery. And let's be honest, we *needed* it."*

Across the table, **Dr. Elena Vasquez**, a neuroscientist who had joined the group after a particularly brutal day of analyzing brain scans, pinched the bridge of her nose. *"Derek, you're not wrong about the *effect*, but the *cause*? You're reaching. We don't even know what happened. All we know is that every opioid, stimulant, depressant-*poof*-gone. Like someone hit the off switch."*

**Captain James "Rook" Calloway**, a retired marine with a permanent scowl and a habit of speaking in clipped, precise sentences, scoffed. *"Or like someone *turned it up*. Either way, it's a disaster. The markets are in freefall. The cartels are *apocalyptic*. And now the governments are scrambling because suddenly, half the world's economy is based on *nothing*."*

Elena shook her head. *"It's not just the economy. The *addiction* crisis-overnight, millions of people are going through withdrawal. Hospitals are overflowing. The UN is calling it a 'public health catastrophe'."*

Derek waved a hand dismissively. *"Pfft. Overrated. People will adapt. They always do. Look at me-I've survived three divorces, a bad haircut, and a lifetime of terrible life choices. I'll survive this."*

**Lena**, a former journalist turned true-crime podcaster, rolled her eyes. *"Derek, you're not helping. The *real* question is-what the hell *caused* this?"*

Rook leaned forward, his voice low and serious. *"I've got a theory. Something in the supply chain. Maybe a contamination. Or a deliberate act. Someone *wanted* this to happen."*

Elena frowned. *"Or it was an accident. A rogue AI, a lab experiment gone wrong-any number of things. But if it was deliberate, we're looking at a geopolitical disaster. Nations are already pointing fingers. Russia's blaming NATO. China's accusing the U.S. of 'biological warfare.' And the cartels? They're *murdering* anyone who knows too much."*

Derek gasped, clutching his chest. *"Oh, *now* you're talking. This is like *The Matrix*, but with more withdrawal symptoms. I'm telling you, this is the start of something *big*. Maybe the universe is trying to tell us something."*

Marlon groaned. *"Or maybe it's just a really bad prank."*

### **The World Changes**

Over the next few weeks, the group's usual gatherings became less about beer and more about survival. The news was a constant stream of chaos:

- **The Cartel Wars**: With their primary revenue stream gone, Mexican and South American cartels had turned on each other, their violence spilling into the U.S. Border states. The DEA was overwhelmed.
- **The Black Market Boom**: Synthetic alternatives flooded the streets, but none worked. Instead, they caused violent hallucinations, seizures, and death. The FDA declared them "unregulated death traps."
- **The Political Fallout**: Governments scrambled to replace lost tax revenue. Some nations proposed legalizing *everything*-even if it didn't work. Others blamed "foreign interference." Conspiracy theories ran rampant.
- **The Addicts**: Rehab centers were full. Overdose deaths plummeted-but suicide rates soared as former addicts, now free of their chemical crutches, faced the harsh reality of sobriety without the escape.

One night, as they sat in stunned silence, Rook finally spoke. *"We're living in a world that doesn't make sense anymore."*

Elena exhaled sharply. *"And we don't even know if it's temporary."*

Derek, ever the optimist, raised his glass. *"But hey-at least we're all sober now! No more of you, Lena, *over-sharing* about your exes. No more, Rook, *grumbling* about everything. No more, *Marlon*, *overpriced* beer."*

Marlon shot him a look. *"Shut up, Derek."*

Lena smirked. *"Or maybe... maybe this is the universe's way of saying we've been doing it wrong for too long."*

Rook didn't smile, but for the first time in years, he didn't scowl either.

Outside, the city lights flickered. Somewhere, a siren wailed. The world had changed.

And none of them knew if it would ever be the same again.
